# Land Registration on the Blockchain
This is a live demo of land assets being registered using the [IPDB test]() blockchain database.

## Create an asset
The asset is created using the Government's private key. In this demo use the following credentials for the government:
*Public key:* Bgb2bJTnXGa4cqe8bXJ54ytYwGszKiiQvRxasru4DAAr
*Private key:* VoQSrCDZG5eMNNsk1N4KYWy5pauvyrHupU1DGBKAAQB'

## Transfer the asset
After you have created the asset, in order to transfer it to someone, generate a key pair for the person (see below). Now input your private key (the government's if its the first transfer) and transfer the asset. 

## Generate and Register a keys
All the generated keys are pseudo-random and are strong enough for our purposes

## Explore the Blockchain
View the history of all the transactions that have been performed on the asset. Remember, since this project is actually hosted on the IPDB test net, the asset can be transfer to someone even without using this web app.
